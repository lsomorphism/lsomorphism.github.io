title: "Arduous"

Hello, I am Layta. I am 17 years old (as of 2023) and I am primarily interested in:
  * CS (computer science)
  * CS theory
  * Compilers
  * Data structures and algorithms
  * Low level systems
  * Binary exploitation

My primary languages I've worked with are (listed in most known - least known):
  * C/C++
  * Rust
  * x86 / x86_64
  * Python
  * OCaml and clojure (really really small amounts)

This website is for posting blogs about whatever I find interesting or something that's complex that I feel needs to be broken down.

You can find all my posts [here](/posts).
